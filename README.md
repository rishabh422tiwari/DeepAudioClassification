# DeepAudioClassification

1) convert audio data to waveform
2) transform waveform to spectrogram
3) classify capuchin bird calls


1 - Bird calls - 3 seconds gonna load and read it in a waveform done with using tf package
2 - convert in the spectogram resons is it is going allow us to use cv techniqyes like cnn to be able to perform the classification  
3 -  push spectogram into cnn which is built with tf - output in binary classification [0,1]
4 - full clip 3 min. push out a csv with all the output.
